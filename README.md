# Snippets
C/C++, JAVA, and potentially other code snippets

The description pretty much says it all.
The primary goal of this repository is simply a place to offer simple code snippets that I choose to share for everyone 
else to use.
All code listed in this repository is covered under the GNU GPL v3.0.
